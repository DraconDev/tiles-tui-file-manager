## Tiles Strengths vs Weaknesses

### Where Tiles Wins (Biggest margins)
| Category | Tiles | Next Best |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Git Integration | 70 | Yazi 15 |
| SSH/Remote | 68 | Yazi 40 |
| System Monitor | 130 | btop 0 (non-compete) |

| Preview (images) | 45 | Yazi 75 |
| Extensibility | 22 | Yazi 40 |
| Process Management | 60 | btop 70 |

## Priority Improvements to Close Gaps

### Done ✅
1. ~~Fuzzy find native~~ — integrated `fuzzy-matcher` (SkimMatcherV2)
2. ~~Process tree view~~ — toggle with `t` key in Processes view
3. ~~Disk I/O rates~~ — read/write MB/s with sparklines
4. ~~Per-interface network~~ — eth0/wlan0 rates from `/proc/net/dev`
5. ~~CPU temperature/frequency~~ — read from `/sys/class/thermal` + `/sys/devices/system/cpu`
6. ~~Signal selection UI~~ — SIGTERM/SIGKILL/etc picker on `k`

### Quick Wins (1-2 sessions)
1. **Per-interface network sparklines** — individual sparkline per interface
2. **Process tree in Applications view** — apply tree_sort to Applications subview
3. **Nice/priority adjustment** — expose renice from sysinfo

### Medium Effort (1-2 weeks)
4. **Plugin system** — expose hooks for community contributions
5. **GPU monitoring** — NVIDIA via `nvidia-smi`, AMD via `rocm-smi`
6. **Battery status** — read from `/sys/class/power_supply`

### Long-term (differentiators)
7. **Async directory loading** — non-blocking reads for large directories
8. **Tab system** — multiple simultaneous file manager tabs
9. **Lazarus integration** — bring lazygit-level git UX into Tiles natively

## Competitive Moat Analysis

**Tiles' secret weapon:** The combination of SSH host management + file browsing + git + system monitor in one consistent TUI. Every rival scores 0 in at least one of these categories:

- Yazi has no SSH manager, no git, no monitor
- Ranger has no SSH manager, no monitor, no native git
- btop is only a monitor
- vifm has no SSH, no git, no monitor

**The question isn't "how does Tiles compare to btop" — it's "who else gives you file manager + monitor + git + SSH in one app?"**

Answer: **Nobody.** That 868/1000 is in a category of one.
