# Tiles QA Matrix

Status legend: `PASS` | `FAIL` | `FIXED` | `N/A`

## Session 2026-05-14 — Terminal Tab Spawning + crates.io Publishing

### Environment
- Date: 2026-05-14
- Build target: v10.34.75 (crates.io)
- Focus areas:
  - Terminal tab spawning (Konsole D-Bus, Kitty, Wezterm, generic fallback)
  - crates.io install verification
  - Dependency resolution from crates.io (no git deps)

### Test Matrix

| ID | Flow | Environment | Steps | Expected | Result |
|----|------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|
| T1 | Konsole tab spawn | Konsole + NixOS | Right-click → Open Terminal Here | New tab in existing Konsole window | |
| T2 | Konsole run script | Konsole + NixOS | Select .sh file, Ctrl+Enter | Script runs in new Konsole tab | |
| T3 | Kitty tab spawn | Kitty | Right-click → Open Terminal Here | New tab via `kitty @ launch` | |
| T4 | Wezterm tab spawn | Wezterm | Right-click → Open Terminal Here | New tab via `wezterm cli spawn` | |
| T5 | Generic fallback | gnome-terminal | Right-click → Open Terminal Here | `--tab` flag used | |
| T6 | cargo install | Clean machine | `cargo install tiles-tui-file-manager` | Binary `tiles` installed | PASS |
| T7 | All deps from crates.io | Any | `cargo build` with crates.io Cargo.toml | No git deps needed | PASS |
| T8 | Unit tests | Any | `cargo test` | 52 tests pass | PASS |

### Known Limitations
- `dbus-send array:string:` uses commas as delimiters — args containing commas will break
- Konsole `runCommand` D-Bus API blocked by security policy (bypassed via `KDBusService.CommandLine`)

## Environment
- Date: 2026-04-22
- Build target: local dev (v0.19.100)
- Focus areas:
  - Git commit view showing "unknown"
  - Click detection coordinates in Git History
  - Various clipboard and refresh issues

## Session 2026-04-22 Fixes

| ID | Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| GC1 | Git commit view shows "unknown" | `dracon-git::show_commit_patch` passes `--` before hash, making git treat hash as path filter | Bypass library with direct `git show --patch --stat --color=never <hash>` in `modules/files.rs` |
| GC2 | Click detection off-by-one | `table_data_start_y = history_area_y + 1` missed header row | Changed to `+ 2` in `events/git.rs` |
| GC3 | Missing redraw on async preview | `Tick` handler didn't set `needs_draw = true` | Added `needs_draw = true` to `Tick` handler |
| GC4 | Paste clipboard cleared on failure | `app.clipboard = None` after failed `try_send` | Check `try_send` result first in both `event_helpers.rs` and `file_manager.rs` |
| GC5 | Hardcoded pane indices in Undo | `RefreshFiles(0)` hardcoded | Iterate `0..app.panes.len()` |
| GC6 | Self-save tracking one-shot | Path removed from `last_self_save` on mtime mismatch | Keep tracking on mismatch |
| GC7 | Preview cache not invalidated | `highlighted_lines` never cleared on save | Set `highlighted_lines = None` on save |
| GC8 | Non-recursive file watcher | `notify::RecursiveMode::NonRecursive` | Changed to `RecursiveMode::Recursive` |

## Environment
- Date: 2026-02-08
- Build target: local dev
- Focus areas:
  - Git page UI bleed into Files page
  - Editor second pane/page behavior
  - Symlink action flow

## Baseline Matrix

| ID | Flow | Mode | Steps | Expected | Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Git -> Files transition | Single pane | Open Git view, navigate list, return to Files | Files UI has only Files elements, no Git artifacts | FAIL (user-reported) |
| G2 | Git -> Files transition | Split pane | Enter Git, switch back, switch pane focus | Both panes show correct Files UI and state | FAIL (suspected) |
| E1 | Open Editor from Files | Single pane | Select file, open editor, return | Works consistently | PASS (initial) |
| E2 | Open Editor from Files | Split pane | Open file in pane 2 / second page path | Second pane/page interactive and renders correctly | FAIL (user-reported) |
| E3 | Editor pane focus swap | Split pane | Switch pane focus while in Editor and edit | Input applies to focused editor pane | FAIL (suspected) |
| S1 | Drag-drop Link action | Single pane | Drag item to folder, choose Link | Symlink created at destination | FAIL (known unhandled event) |
| S2 | Drag-drop Link action | Split pane | Same as S1 with opposite pane target | Symlink created and pane refreshes | FAIL (known unhandled event) |
| R1 | Copy action refresh | Split pane | Copy from pane 2, watch destination pane | Correct pane refreshes | FAIL (known hardcoded pane refresh) |
| A1 | Mouse move/drag stability | Any | Move/drag over file table extensively | No panic or overflow | FAIL (panic in debug.log) |

## Work Log

- [x] Patch Git->Files bleed-over
- [x] Patch Editor second page behavior
- [x] Implement Symlink event handling
- [x] Patch arithmetic/refresh safety issues
- [x] Re-run build/tests and update matrix

## Final Results

Code-level verification completed on 2026-02-08:

| ID | Final | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | FIXED | Added Git->Files transition cleanup (mode/input reset, Git selection reset, git:// preview cleanup). |
| G2 | FIXED | Same transition cleanup applies in split mode; refresh path retained. |
| E1 | PASS | Existing flow unchanged; compiles and routes as expected. |
| E2 | FIXED | Removed forced editor split-collapse and aligned editor pane geometry with renderer. |
| E3 | FIXED | Editor mouse/area targeting now uses shared pane-area calculation; focus routing stabilized. |
| S1 | FIXED | `AppEvent::Symlink` now executed with status feedback and refresh. |
| S2 | FIXED | Symlink handling refreshes panes whose `current_path` matches destination parent. |
| R1 | FIXED | Copy now refreshes destination-matching panes instead of hardcoded pane `0`. |
| A1 | FIXED | Added arithmetic guards (`saturating_add`, pane-width guards, offset underflow safety). |

Manual interactive validation is still recommended for UI feel/regression checks in a real terminal session.
