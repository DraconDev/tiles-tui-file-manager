## Dependencies

| Crate | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `dracon-terminal-engine` | Git (dracon-libs) | Terminal runtime, compositor, input parser, ratatui bridge, widgets |
| `dracon-files` | Git (dracon-libs) | Filesystem operations, metadata, search |
| `dracon-git` | Git (dracon-libs) | Git log, diff, status parsing |
| `dracon-system` | Git (dracon-libs) | System stats, SSH remote operations |

## Running

```bash
# Debug mode
cargo run

# Release mode
cargo run --release

# With debug logging (writes to debug.log)
TILES_DEBUG_LOG=1 cargo run
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run clippy linter
cargo clippy

# Both should pass with 0 warnings before submitting
cargo test && cargo clippy
```

## Key Patterns

### Event Flow
1. Input thread reads stdin → parses via `dracon-terminal-engine::input::parser`
2. Raw events sent through `mpsc` channel to main loop
3. Main loop dispatches to handler functions in `events/`
4. Handlers modify `App` state and may send `AppEvent` back through channel

### Locking
- `App` is wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<App>>`
- Keep lock hold time minimal — clone data out, release lock, process
- The main event loop holds the lock briefly per event
- Spawned tasks (`tokio::spawn`) clone the Arc and acquire lock only to apply results

### File Watching
- Uses `notify-debouncer-mini` with 200ms debounce
- `Recursive` mode — watches directory trees (expanded folders and their contents)
- `sync_watches` has fast bail-out when paths haven't changed

### Editor Clipboard Pattern
The editor uses a unified clipboard model:
- **Internal buffer**: `app.editor_clipboard` — source of truth for Copy/Paste round-tripping
- **System clipboard**: `dracon_terminal_engine::utils::set_clipboard_text()` — syncs to OS clipboard for external apps
- **Paste order**: Internal buffer first, falls back to system clipboard
- **Copy/Cut**: Write to both internal buffer and system clipboard
- **Borrow safety**: When modifying `app.editor_clipboard` AND borrowing the editor, extract data first in a separate scope:
  ```rust
  // Correct: extract text first (borrow ends), then modify clipboard
  let text = { if let Some(editor) = get_active_editor_mut(app) { editor.get_selected_text() } else { None } };
  if let Some(text) = text {
      app.editor_clipboard = Some(text.clone());
      let _ = copy_text_to_clipboard(&text);
  }
  ```

## Merging Code

### Merge Safety Rules
**Never merge orphaned or divergent branches blindly.** When merging branches that have diverged significantly:
1. Review ALL changes before merging
2. Prefer `git cherry-pick` for specific commits rather than merging divergent histories
3. Always run `cargo build && cargo test` before pushing merged code
4. If merge conflicts occur on binary files (Cargo.lock, Cargo.toml), prefer `--ours` to keep your current dependency versions
5. If structural conflicts occur in source files, do NOT use `--theirs` blindly — this causes catastrophic API mismatches

### Why Cherry-Pick Over Merge?
Branches that have been developed in isolation often have incompatible API versions, missing modules, or deleted features. A merge that looks clean can produce dozens of compilation errors. Cherry-picking specific commits lets you apply only the changes you actually need.

## Code Style

- No comments in code unless specifically asked
- Follow existing patterns in neighboring files
- Use `crate::` imports for cross-module references
- Prefer `PathBuf` over `String` for path handling
- Use `ratatui::layout::Rect` for bounds tracking
